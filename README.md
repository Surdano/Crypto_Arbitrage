## The Analyzer

The Crypto Arbitrage Analyzer is a Python-based Jupyter Notebook that sorts through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. This analysis considers arbitrage opportunities using closing prices between the two exchanges during a three month period in 2018.

---
## Technologies
This analyzer was created on Python 3.7 with [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install) and uses the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) libraries.

---
## Installation Guide
The dependencies needed to use the anaylzer are:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
```

---
## Usage
Launch Jupyter Lab and run the program 
```python
crypto_arbitrage.ipynb
```
Once the data has been collected and read-in by running the cells, the program will start displaying plots representing different pieces of data that look like this:
* Bitcoin's Closing Price January 28th, 2018 - Bitstamp v. Coinbase:
